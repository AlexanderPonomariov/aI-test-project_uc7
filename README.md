# Use Case #7:

Create unit tests that cover functionality to improve the quality and safety of the application

## Use Case Description

Create unit tests that cover individual functions or methods by using testing libraries. Additionally, group related tests by the respective suite and write common configurations for the tests that should be executed before and after each test in the suite. Further, use the solution to optimize element selections and matching when necessary.

## Test Overview

The test suite provided primarily focuses on the validation and functionality of a form component named `<MyFormComponent />`. The form seems to be structured around collecting user information including their name, email, gender, and agreement to terms. The tests ensure the accurate rendering of form elements, validation of form input fields, and the proper functioning of API calls upon form submissions. Mocked fetch responses are used to simulate API interactions.

## Test Specifics

There are multiple individual test cases within the suite:

1. **Rendering Tests**: These ensure all necessary form fields and buttons are rendered correctly.
2. **Validation Tests**: These are centered around validation messages - ensuring that they appear when needed and are absent when the form is correctly filled.
3. **Submission Tests**: These test cases verify that upon submission, the correct API calls are made with the expected payloads. There's also validation to ensure that the component can handle a variety of edge cases such as long names and complex email formats.
4. **Re-submission Test**: This checks that the form can be submitted multiple times in succession without issues.
5. **Error Scenarios**: The test suite also covers scenarios where the user might not fill the form correctly, checking that the appropriate error messages are displayed.

## ðŸš€ Running Tests Locally

Before running tests, ensure you've set up your project by following the initial installation and setup instructions.

### 1. **Install Dependencies**:

If you haven't already installed the project dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```
or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn
```

### 2. **Running Tests**:

To execute all tests:
```bash
npm test
```
or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn test
```
By default, this command runs tests in a watch mode. You can navigate and use the watch mode using the CLI interface it provides.

### 3. **Running a Single Test**:

To run a specific test or test suite, simply provide its path or filename as an argument:
```bash
npm test /path/to/your/test/file.test.js

```
or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn test /path/to/your/test/file.test.js
```

### 4. **Generating Test Coverage**:

For a coverage report:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```
or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn test --coverage
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
