Of course! Here's a sample "Information on how to run tests locally" block for your README.md:

ðŸš€ Running Tests Locally
Before running tests, ensure you've set up your project by following the initial installation and setup instructions.

1. Install Dependencies:
If you haven't already installed the project dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
or

bash
Copy code
yarn
(if you are using yarn as your package manager).

2. Running Tests:
To run all tests, use:

bash
Copy code
npm test
or

bash
Copy code
yarn test
By default, this will run tests in a watch mode. You can interact with the watch mode using the provided CLI interface.

3. Running a Single Test:
If you wish to run a specific test or test suite, you can provide the path or filename as an argument:

bash
Copy code
npm test /path/to/your/test/file.test.js
or

bash
Copy code
yarn test /path/to/your/test/file.test.js
4. Generating Test Coverage:
To generate a coverage report, you can use:

bash
Copy code
npm test -- --coverage
or

bash
Copy code
yarn test --coverage
This will generate a coverage directory in your project root, which provides detailed information on test coverage for your components.

Note: Modify the above instructions as needed based on your project's configuration and any custom scripts or tools you might be using.
